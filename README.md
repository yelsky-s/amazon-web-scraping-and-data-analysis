amazon web scraping and data analysis - science books example

In this example I search through several pages on amazon on search for science books, aggregating some info for each found items(book title, author, price...) and adding it to csv file.
Then some data cleaning and data analysis was peformed on the accumulated data with jupyter nootbook and the final data is stored as an excel file.
CSV, Jupyter Nootbook and Excel is included in this repository.
